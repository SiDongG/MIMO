%INPUT:
%R                 = M x M x K x L x L matrix with spatial correlation
%                    matrices for all UEs in the network. R(:,:,k,j,l) is
%                    the correlation matrix for the channel between UE k 
%                    in cell j and the BS in cell l. This such matrix can
%                    either include the average channel gain or can be
%                    normalized arbitrarily.
%channelGaindB     = K x L x L matrix containing the average channel gains
%                    in dB of all the channels, if these are not already
%                    included in the spatial channel correlation matrices. 
%                    The product R(:,:,k,j,l)*10^(channelGaindB(k,j,l)/10) 
%                    is the full spatial channel correlation matrix.
%nbrOfRealizations = Number of channel realizations
%M                 = Number of antennas per BS
%K                 = Number of UEs per cell

%
%OUTPUT:
%Hhat_MMSE    = M x nbrOfRealizations x K x L x L matrix with the MMSE
%               channel estimates. The matrix Hhat_MMSE(:,n,k,j,l) is the
%               n:th channel estimate of the channel between UE k in cell j
%               and the BS in cell l.
%C_MMSE       = M x M x K x L x L matrix with estimation error correlation
%               matrices when using MMSE estimation. The matrix is
%               organized in the same way as R.
%tau_p        = Length of pilot sequences
%R            = Scaled version of the input spatial correlation matrices R,

%H            = M x nbrOfRealizations x K x L x L matrix with the true
%               channel realizations. The matrix is organized in the same
%               way as Hhat_MMSE.
%Hhat_EW_MMSE = Same as Hhat_MMSE, but using the EW-MMSE estimator
